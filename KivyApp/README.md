# Simply Kivy App

## Overview

This was made as an introductory tutorial for students in Computer Science interested in Kivy development. The status on the switches were made to be synchronous with the database. A Raspberry Pi also has connection to this database and can write switch status 1 to it. The Kivy App automatically reads and updates the status of the switches. The App can write switch status 2 to the database, which updates on the Raspberry Pi side.
